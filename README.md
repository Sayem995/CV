Aspiring **Full Stack Software Engineer** determined to find a role in which I can add value and grow to become a world class software engineer. As a recent graduate of a leading software development boot camp, [Makers](https://makers.tech/), I strive to adhere to practices such as TDD/BDD and adopt an Agile development approach. Currently I am focused on enhancing my proficiency in building full stack JavaScript applications with frameworks such as React and Node.

Previously I was pursuing a career in business with accounting, however I found it rather uninspiring and monotonous. After exploring various online resources about coding, I arrived at the conclusion that it very much appealed to my logic and found it hugely stimulating. I recognised that coding triggered within me a compulsive desire to solve problems and allowed me the flexibility to produce innovative solutions to these problems.

With the intention to dive head first into this new industry, I attended Makers, where I learned that not all problems can be solved on your own, rather a collaborative effort is fundamental to problem solving.

## Skills

#### This Skill
#### Self-Driven Independent Learner
I do not believe that learning is only for school or job purposes. I believe that learning is a never ending journey. When I chose the path of a software engineer, I did so with the idea that it must become my bread and butter and concluded that programming is a skill that I must endeavour to master.

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence
Whenever I am in a new working environment, I realise that I have to actively adjust by taking initiative to learn the ins and outs of my responsibilities. In my previous work as an Accounting Intern, I had to teach myself various practical skills such as expanding my knowledge of excel for bookkeeping and account management as well as learning how to manage the payroll system.

#### Another Skill
I am also currently teaching myself how to invest in the Forex market. By learning online and reading books on technical analysis, I have become a much more confident trader.

#### Effective Communication with Others
 In this day and age it is crucial to be able to work well with others. I believe that I possess the emotional intelligence skills in order to collaborate with others effectively. My experience of working with other people range from being insistent with group members at Makers regarding having regular meetings to either, catch members up with the progress of the project, or slow members down from going off on a tangent to the objective, to leading the cricket team at University alongside fellow team members, to coordinate events with other clubs and societies and arranging matches or tournaments with other nearby cricket clubs and universities. In my opinion, it is important to be both considerate as well as honest towards others in order to maintain a healthy work relationship.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
#### Makers (July 2018 - October 2018)

I attended a 16 week Software Engineering Bootcamp where I learnt programming fundamentals and best practices: OOP, BDD, TDD, Pair Programming, MVC architecture, SOLID principles, Agile methodologies. I believe that Makers provided me with a strong foundation to self guide my learning process with the aim of becoming a high calibre Software Engineer.

Although I found the course challenging and had very basic programming knowledge at the start of the course, I did not let that hinder my passion to learn. I persevered with the course, endeavouring to retain all that I could within them 16 weeks. I have utilized many resources (books, youtube, coding websites) in order to support my learning and will continue to do so throughout my career. From my perspective, if I were to work in a team, I would not like that my lack of knowledge would inconvenience my team, therefore it is imperative for me to continually widen my knowledge and skills base. Fortunately, when it comes to coding, there are unlimited amount of resources out there for me to benefit from.

At Makers I have had plenty of experience pair programming and working in groups. Pair programming has been greatly beneficial, especially when following a certain configuration such as the ping pong technique. This way both partners learn how the other solves problems differently. These experiences have given me greater insight on how best to break down problems into manageable chunks. Another essential lesson I have gained from working in larger groups is that communication between all members is absolutely imperative to the success of the group. During group work, I have been insistent that we held regular stand ups, code reviews and retro's, I appreciate how difficult it is to get everyone on the same page, however without this organisation, the team will fail to collaborate effectively.

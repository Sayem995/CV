Aspiring **Full Stack Software Engineer** determined to find a role in which I can add value and grow to become a world class software engineer. As a recent graduate of a leading software development boot camp, [Makers](https://makers.tech/), I strive to adhere to practices such as TDD/BDD and adopt an Agile development approach. Currently I am focused on enhancing my proficiency in building full stack JavaScript applications with frameworks such as React and Node.

Previously I was pursuing a career in business with accounting, however I found it rather uninspiring and monotonous. After exploring various online resources about coding, I arrived at the conclusion that it very much appealed to my logic and found it hugely stimulating. I recognised that coding triggered within me a compulsive desire to solve problems and allowed me the flexibility to produce innovative solutions to these problems.

With the intention to dive head first into this new industry, I attended Makers, where I learned that not all problems can be solved on your own, rather a collaborative effort is fundamental to problem solving.

## Skills

#### Self-Driven Independent Learner
Whenever I am in a new working environment, I realise that I have to actively adjust by taking initiative to learn the ins and outs of my responsibilities. In my previous work at a start-up, I had to teach myself various practical skills such as expanding my knowledge of excel for bookkeeping and account management as well as learning how to manage the payroll system.

I am also currently teaching myself how to invest in the Forex market. By learning online and reading books on technical analysis, I have become a much more confident trader.

#### Effective Communication with Others
 In this day and age it is crucial to be able to work well with others. I believe that I possess the emotional intelligence skills in order to collaborate with others effectively. My experience of working with other people range from being insistent with group members at Makers regarding having regular meetings to either, catch members up with the progress of the project, or slow members down from going off on a tangent to the objective, to actively taking part in sports that were heavily dependent on team work. Also having worked in Sales, effective communication is a skill I believe to have refined.
